# CPU-Project
This project involved using the Logisim software to create a fully-functional CPU with working RAM, accumulator, TTY, register files, ALU, etc. All modules and wiring were done by hand. Here is what the design looked like over time:

In the final iteration, labels made the wire management much easier since they essentially created fictitious connections. This also allowed me to save circuit designs as modules and implement them within other circuit designs.
